This is a tool to help a Dungeon Master run D&D encounters.

The app is deployed here: 

[https://benjamin-t-brown.github.io/dnd-encounters/](https://benjamin-t-brown.github.io/dnd-encounters/)

To use github db:

I was on the D&D Beyond site messing around with their encounter runner, and I felt that it was lacking in some areas.  I've made an attempt to improve upon their design.  In addition, I have provided a way to import their monsters into the application as you need them.  All you need to do is copy the contents of their monster page into the tool and it will parse it out for you.

To run an encounter requires some setup:

1. First create a Party, including all your players.

2. You can use the existing basic list of monsters or if you want you can create creatures.
  You can do this by entering everything manually, or you can import a character directly from D&D Beyond by copying the info block from the unit's page.
  
For example, to add a "Goblin Boss" from the basic monster set,
  - go to the unit's page https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17155-goblin-boss
  - copy the unit's block

  - click to create a unit, then click to paste the stat block, and paste it in

  - your unit is now imported!


3. Then you can create an encounter template, adding creatures into it as you please

4. Once you have these things, you can create a new encounter and run it!
